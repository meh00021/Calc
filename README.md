# Using the dc calculator
**========================**

The 'dc' program is a calculaotr app. It supports a variety of 
calculations including:
According to the "manual page" or man page" on Unix: the dc calculator is:

> 'dc'(1) is a command line desk calc app. 
> It uses a reverse polish notation number, where it is stored in a
> stack and the user opertaers te calculations.

* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide
Can add asterisks to create bullet points
To use a reverse polish calculator, you enter the numbers first
and then the operation.
For example, to multiply the numbers 6 and 7,
you would do this:


1. Enter 'c' clear the memory.
1. Enter the number '6'
2. Enter the number '7'
3. Enter an * to multiply 
4. Enter 'p' to print the result

Here's a sample 'dc'session that multiplies 6 and 7:


''''
c
6
7
*
p
42
```
blocking = fills rectangle
And that's how your calculate with 'dc'.

**#1 thing that I've found interesting about using markdown is the

* accessibility options: for example

- diverse uses of originally making titles
- bolded letters
- changing it to italic
- blocking squares 

+ the most fun part, which is: the creativity coming along with MINDS!!

**Part 2 of why GitHub is an essential tool =**

- How easy it is to navigate
- The *font* style, kind of like a typewriter. It's easy to read and clearly understand.
Another reason I find this platform to be a need for any intermediate or advanced writer is because of the readability, organization of the structure going down
`V
`E
`R

`I
`C

+ that there's no restrictions for worded guidlines

`An example of this:
- Unbiased language
- Autocorrect
-AND ETC!

**What is challenging about Markdown?**

It is the way everything is so diverse and different from one another, there's too many ways to make your writing better by adding symbols, grammatical corrections, etc. I think what's really special about Markdown is the listing of the numbers, automatically counting up by itself as the writer continues to type onto their laptop, sharing ideas that'd make a worthy change. That way, the writer can easily keep track of their writing, and not mess up along the way. I think the numbers also help to create a list of ideas that the writer can go back to, just by memorizing a set of numbers, in a situation where their writing is chatic or they haven't had a good plan at the start, and want to change or switch things up correctly. 

Markdown gifts writers many opportunities to better their mistakes or just to gain a more thorough understanding of techincal editing. Markdown is very easy but hard, depending on what level of writing one currently knows or what writing experience they have. Sometimes though, one has to reenter, retype, rewrite, erase, and just do about anything to fix an unwanted sentence or unnecesary character that was added. Another thing I think makes Markdown harder to use is the sizing of the letters, which are extremely small looking at it from a distance. I always feel like I'm using an old typewriter machine from back in the 80s whenever I use Markdown, because of the spacing of the letters. I would prefer the background color to be an option to change, to suit the writer's preferences and prevent troubles.

**Why a writer would love using Markdown?**

It is because of the before and after, and what I mean by that is the edit versus preview side, + the final results after commiting changes. The editing process is really important, as it gives the writer plenty of time to process their thoughts and prevent any mistakes, but it also allows the writer to save changes too. The preview is almost like the finalized version but just a little less step closer. It gives the writer a better understanding of everything they just thought to themselves in silence. The editing is a step closer to the finalized piece, or masterpiece I'd say, that'd help save lots of time for the writer.

The next thing that I would love about Markdown IF I was a professional writer is the way there is no limit to the words optionally AND no limit to , the screen keeps going down as the typing keeps counting rapidly every and each second...
